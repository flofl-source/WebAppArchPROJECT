# QUIZZ App

## What my App does : 
My app created from scratch make the user start with the movie "Mean Girls". The user has to choose the name of an actor or the director of this movie. 

* If this actor or director indeed worked for this movie, the picture of her/him is displayed. 

Then, the user has to enter the name of a movie in which this actor or director appears. If the movie is right, an image of it is display with the title and release year.

All this app is connected to the tmdb API.

If the user enters a wrong name or title, a red message is display bellow the button. 

If the user enters the name of a movie or an actor that already has been entered or seen, an re message is also displayed bellow the button.
