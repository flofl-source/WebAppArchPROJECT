# QUIZZ App

## What my App does : 
My app created from scratch make the user start with the movie "Mean Girls". The user has to choose the name of an actor or the director of this movie. 

* If the entered actor or director indeed worked for this movie, the picture of her/him is displayed + his/her name

* Then, the user has to enter the name of a movie in which this actor or director appears. If the movie is right, an image of it is displayed with the title and release year.

* All this app is connected to the tmdb API.

* If the user enters a wrong name or title, a red message is display bellow the button. 

* If the user enters the name of a movie or an actor that already has been entered or seen, an re message is also displayed bellow the button.
