        <h1>Welcome to my Movie Quizz !</h1>
        <p> The rules of the quizz are simple : <br> For each movie, you have to give the full name of the person that directed it or an actor. If you are right then you have to give the title of an other movie in which this same director/actor directed/played. If you are right, you have to write the full name of a person that played or directed this movie. And so on ! <br> Of course, you cannot write two times the same title of movie or name of director/actor. </p>
