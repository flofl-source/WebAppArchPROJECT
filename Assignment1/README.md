# Whiteboard

I took this code from : https://github.com/Tnemlec/Whiteboard

Before executing server.js, you must write the following command in your terminal:

    npm install

so that it will download all the node_modules

## What did I change ? 

I added a button in the menubar to show the image we created down the page. 
This image will be static, and can be saved by the user using right click | save image as.
